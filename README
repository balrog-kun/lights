My code for a simple home automation setup based on cheap Arduino
Pro Mini clones, relays and nRF24L01+ modules.  It will also work
as a simple wireless sensor network and perhaps collect statistics
about the use of each light.

There is little actual automation here, it replicates the original
setup with working wall switches.  Each wall switch is connected to
digital ground and an Arduino GPIO through a long cable.  Lights are
connected to the mains through a relay driven by another Arduino
GPIO.
